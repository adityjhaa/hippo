# HIPPO

**An interpreter for the Hippo programming language built in *Go*!**

I've currently started reading <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/"><b>Writing an Interpreter in Go</b></a> by <b>Thorsten Bell</b>. Bell believes "<i>Interpreters are Magical!</i>" and so are they. The book covers fundamental concepts of interpreters, such as lexical analysis, parsing, and evaluation. We'll follow Bell's approach and work on each part in stages.


#### Stage 1 : The Lexer

We'll first create a lexer that takes as input our source code, does the lexical analysis and returns the tokens it creates along the way. This makes it easier for us to work with. It'll turn our <b>Hippo</b> code into the tokens designed by us.
